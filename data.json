    "Alpha":`Also known as ",("B.1.1.7","\n","#8ef")," and ",("Î±","","#faa"),("Alpha","","#1212")" Announced on the 14 Dec 2020, this variant appears to have arisen and/or initially expanded in the South East of England.Variant20I(Alpha, V1) is associated with multiple mutations in Spike. Most notably: S:N501Y (see MutationS:N501), and a deletion at 69/70 (see MutationS:H69-)But also MutationS:Y144- (deletion) and S:P681H (adjacent to the furin cleavage siteThere is also a notable truncation of ORF8, with ORF8:Q27* (becomes a stop codon) (deletion of ORF8 was previously associated with reduced clinical severity (Young et al., Lancet )), and mutations in Nucleocapsid: N:D3L and N:S235F, as well as a deletion in ORF1a(Nsp6) 3675-3677 (also seen in 20H(Beta, V2) and 20J(Gamma, V3), as well as some other variants of interest) (see MutationORF1a:S3675).The 69/70 deletion in this variant causes the S-assay within TaqPath tests to give a negative result, which can provide a useful proxy for prevalence of this variant (a phenomenon referred to as S-gene target failure or SGTF). However, as the 69/70 deletion is found in other variants/clusters (notably Variant20A/S:439K and MutationS:Y453F), sequencing is needed to confirm identity, particularly in countries where 20I(Alpha, V1) is not dominant.A small number  of 20I(Alpha, V1) genomes have been observed in the UK featuring the S:E484K mutation (see these on the focal MutationS:E484 Nextstrain build here ).`,
